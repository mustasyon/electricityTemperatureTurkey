# Climate change impacts on electricity demand in Turkey
Climatic temperature changes are effective in the use of energy sources. 
There is a close relationship between electrical energy demand and temperature. 
The decision of people on using heaters or coolers refers to some kind of temperature threshold. 
In this study, a balance point temperature calculated for Turkey with help from the monthly demand data of January 2000 to December 2018.
Then a function model that can be used to predict the electricity energy demand was developed using temperature average and time series.
